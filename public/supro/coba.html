    <p class="grid__description">The next 3-5 years of web design are going to be an amazing era of experimentation on the web (hopefully). Reading articles by Jen Simmons and others makes me really want to coin the phrase "Punk Rock Web Design" since they look to take inspiration from the 70s and 80s of graphic design. This will be an amazing time... as long as we remember to keep things usable. This design meditation is me trying to push my boundaries of what layout is. Open up dev tools (in Firefox especially) to view the Grid layout I'm playing with.</p>
